# stock-market-prediction
This project predicts the price of the stocks and visualizing the data.

**Stock Market Prediction** - An application for predicting and analysing stock trends.

üëã **About This Project**<br>
Stock Market Prediction and Analysis is a machine learning-driven web application designed for financial forecasting. It uses Keras for building a predictive deep learning model and Streamlit for the interactive user interface. 

üîë **Key Features**<br>
Historical Stock Data: The app visualizes stock data from 2007 to 2022, along with descriptive statistics.<br>
Moving Average Charts: Display 100-day (MA100) and 200-day (MA200) moving averages on top of the closing price data.<br>
LSTM-based Stock Price Prediction: Predict future stock prices using the trained LSTM model and compare predicted vs. actual stock prices.<br>
Interactive UI: Users can input any stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL", "GOOG") and dynamically view the analysis and predictions.<br>

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**<br>

Python Libraries:<br>
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
NumPy: For numerical computing.<br>
Matplotlib: For plotting stock price visualizations.<br>
yfinance: For fetching historical stock data.<br>
pandas_datareader: For additional data fetching.<br>
Keras/TensorFlow: For training and utilizing the LSTM model.<br>
Streamlit: For building an interactive web app.<br>
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and scaling.<br>

Machine Learning Model:<br>
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model used to predict future stock prices based on past data, capturing temporal dependencies in the data.<br>
Dropout: A regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in the model.<br>

üéØ **My Learnings**
LSTM Model: Successfully trained and deployed an LSTM model for stock price prediction, demonstrating deep learning capabilities.<br>
Real-Time Interaction: Built an interactive web interface using Streamlit, making the app easy to use for any stock ticker.<br>
Data Visualization: Provided insightful visualizations like Moving Averages and Predicted vs Actual Prices, aiding in stock market analysis.<br>
